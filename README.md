# zenlib-test

This is a test project for [zenlib](https://github.com/zendo-games/zenlib).

It can be brought into a new libgdx project by adding the following to the `dependencies` section of the `core` project in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
  api "com.github.zendo-games:zenlib:$zenlibVersion"
```
Where `$zenlibVersion` is the version of zenlib you want to use and is set in the `gradle.properties` file.
Use `zenlibVersion=main-SNAPSHOT` to get the latest version, however if making updates to the library while working on the main project 
it can be finicky to make sure gradle pulls the latest version based on that tag. In those cases it's better to set `zenlibVersion` to the most recent commit hash.

## About

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
- `android`: Android mobile platform. Needs Android SDK.
- `html`: Web platform using GWT and WebGL. Supports only Java projects.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `android:lint`: performs Android project validation.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `html:dist`: compiles GWT sources. The compiled application can be found at `html/build/dist`: you can use any HTTP server to deploy it.
- `html:superDev`: compiles GWT sources and runs the application in SuperDev mode. It will be available at [localhost:8080/html](http://localhost:8080/html). Use only during development.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/lib`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
